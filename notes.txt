QUESTION 1:
32-bit logical and physical addresses
Logical address space = 2^m = 2^32 bytes
Page size = 2^n = 2^12 = 4 KB 

m = 32
n = 12
physical address = { physical page #, 20 bits | page offset, 12 bits }

QUESTION 2:
16-bit logical addresses
Logical address space = 2^m = 2^16 bytes
2^8 entries in page table
Page size = 2^n = 2^8 = 256 B

m = 16
n = 8
logical address = { page #, 8 bits | page offset, 8 bits }
